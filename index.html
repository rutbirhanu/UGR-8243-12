                After graduating from Exeter in 2002, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University. After his sophomore year, Zuckerberg dropped out of college to devote himself to his new company, Facebook, full time.

                By his sophomore year at the Ivy League institution, he had developed a reputation as the</p><p> go-to software developer on campus. It was at that time that he built a program called CourseMatch, which helped students choose their classes based on the course selections of other users.
                
                He also invented Facemash, which compared the pictures of two students on campus and allowed users to vote on which one was more attractive. </p><p>The program became wildly popular, Zuckerberg agreed to help with the project, but soon dropped out to work on his own social networking site, The Facebook.but was later shut down by the school administration after it was deemed inappropriate.
